**Important Note:**

> Upon receiving the ESP32-S3-BOX-3, we advise updating the built-in factory firmware to ensure you have the latest bugfixes via Espressif's online firmware flashing tool ESP Launchpad. Up till now, the latest version is **ESP-BOX-3_Demo_V1.2.4**. To verify the software version, please go to the 'About Us' Page.

The ESP-BOX is an advanced AIoT, Edge AI, and IIoT applications development platform released by Espressif Systems. The ESP32-S3-BOX, ESP32-S3-BOX-Lite, and ESP32-S3-BOX-3 are a series of development boards designed for this platform, they are built on Espressif’s powerful ESP32-S3 Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 5 (LE) SoC and feature compact and beautiful enclosures. Leveraging the multi-functional accessories and reliable examples from the repo’s, these development boards cater to both prototyping new projects and building complex IoT systems, providing a perfect balance of form and function.

ESP-BOX provides a platform for developing applications in various domains, including Offline Voice Assistants, Online AI Chatbots (developed using OpenAI and other large language model platforms), Matter Device/Controller, Robot Controller, USB Device/Host, Wireless Sensor Application and a wide range of Human Machine Interaction (HMI) applications.

**Note 1**: Upon receiving the ESP32-S3-BOX and ESP32-S3-BOX-Lite, we advise updating the [built-in factory firmware](./docs/firmware_update.md) to ensure you have the latest bug fixes. In the master branch, we will gradually offer limited support for these two development boards. For further information, kindly refer to the examples readme.

**Note 2**: The ESP32-S3-BOX-3 offers two different versions: ESP32-S3-BOX-3 and ESP32-S3-BOX-3B. The ESP32-S3-BOX-3 represents the standard edition with four blue accessories, the ESP32-S3-BOX-3B provides fewer accessories to meet starters who don’t need much unnecessary hardware. For more details on the distinctions, please check [here](https://github.com/espressif/esp-box/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md#variant-description).

## Developer Guide

ESP-BOX integrates ESP-IDF components commonly used in AIoT development from [ESP Registry](https://components.espressif.com/components?q=lcd) that you can leverage to build your own applications.

### Quick Start

* **Step 1**. ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework) is required to build the application. If this is your first time using the ESP-IDF, please refer to [ESP-IDF development guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s3/index.html) to understand the open-source drivers and components provided by Espressif.
* **Step 2**. Next, setting up development environment. Please refer to [ESP-IDF (release/v5.1) Installation Step by Step](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/release-v5.1/esp32s3/get-started/index.html#ide).
* **Step 3**. Run command `git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-box.git` to download the code of this project and then switch the ESP-IDF version to [specified version](#versions);
* **Step 4**. Take a small step, you can [build and flash a simple example](./examples/image_display).
* **Step 5**. Moving further, please read [ESP-BOX technical architecture](./docs/technical_architecture.md) to understand the technical details.
* **Step 6**. Going deeper, please read [ESP Speech Recognition Application Guide](https://github.com/espressif/esp-sr), [ESP RainMaker Programming Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-rainmaker/en/latest/), [LVGL GUI Quick overview](https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/).
* **Step 7**. For extended function, please read [Pmod™ compatible headers](./docs/hardware_overview) and [ESP-IDF API reference](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/release-v5.1/esp32s3/api-reference/index.html), to develop drivers for more extended devices.
### Cloud Quick Start
The ESP BOX APP is built based on the commercial mobile APP architecture, Nova Home, which provides fancy UI and better user experience but has limited openness. To gain access to it, customers are required to contact us commercially via email at sales@espressif.com.
For developer, we offer [ESP RainMaker](https://rainmaker.espressif.com/) solution, which includes publicly available development document and API guide. Below is the pathway to access them:
* [ESP RainMaker Get Started](https://rainmaker.espressif.com/docs/get-started.html)
* [ESP RainMaker Programming Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-rainmaker/en/latest/)
* [RainMaker App APIs Definitions](https://swaggerapis.rainmaker.espressif.com)

### NuttX
The ESP32-S3-BOX-3 also supports integration with [NuttX](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/tree/master/boards/xtensa/esp32s3/esp32s3-box), offering further flexibility and functionality. Nuttx is a real-time operating system (RTOS) known for its compact size, efficiency, and real-time performance, making it an excellent choice for embedded systems.
