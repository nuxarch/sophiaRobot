## Disassembly Tutorial

### What Do You Need

- Size #1 Phillips-Head Screwdriver

### Components Overview

The following tutorial will guide you to disassemble the development board step-by-step. Once you have dissembled the development board, there will be six main components as shown below. This tutorial will not cover how to disassemble the layer 1, 5, 7 and 9 as they are held with permanent adhesives. Please keep them well.

- Move the top case and bottom case apart carefully to expose the main board. Observe that the LCD, touch panel, and speaker is connected to the main board by a 20 pin FPC cable, 8 pin FPC cable, and JST connector respectively. Unlock the two FPC connectors, and disconnect the speaker to separate the top case and bottom case.

- Unscrew the two screws on the microphone sub-board and remove the sub-board completely.

- The dust covers are located on the microphone of the sub-board. It is NOT recommended to remove them as they are glued to the top case.

- The touch screen is glued to the top case. It is NOT recommended to disassemble it as there is a risk of damaging the FPC cable and the glass cover of the touch screen. 

- The speaker is located on the inside of the top case. It is NOT recommended to remove it as it is glued to the top case.

## Assembly Tips

Assembly is as simple as reversing the above disassembly tutorial but to facilitate a smoother assembly experience, this section will cover some of the assembly issues and things to take note before assembly.

### Things to note
- Ensure that the speaker wire is not covering the screw holes of the main board PCBA before screwing in the screws.
- When placing the bottom case onto the top case, do so by aligning the side with the PMOD first, before putting the case together.
- When placing the bottom case onto the top case, Ensure that the snap fits near the PMOD are fully in place before screwing in the last 2 screws.
